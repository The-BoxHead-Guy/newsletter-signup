## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- JAVASCRIPT
- OBJECTS
- Google Font API

### What I learned

I learned how to validate emails using javascript, by implement comparatives after taking the user's input (email) with a RegExp which is a source of information that set how the strings should be represented, also, by using Objects in order to develop the solution which contracted in a better and straightforward solution

### Continued development

I will continue learning how to keep making code using javascript for future projects, enhance my skill at manipulating the DOM and setting better names for javascript functions and variables.
